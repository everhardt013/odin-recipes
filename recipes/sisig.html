    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>“It's hot, sizzling, crispy, sticky, delicious bits of pork with many textures,” 
        Bourdain says. “It's exactly what you need after a few beers and that's a perfect food.”</p>

    <p>Sisig is a Filipino street food that is typically made with different pig parts such as 
        pig's ears, head, brains, etc. It has been reinvented by the Sisig Queen, 
        Aling Lucing or Lucia Cunanan, from Pampanga, the Culinary Capital of the Philippines, 
        as a pork dish that can be enjoyed by everyone.</p>

    <p>This Filipino food can be whatever you want it to be. You can make it vegetarian using 
        tofu and vegetables or even chicken sisig, squid sisig, or tuna sisig. As 
        long as you have the flavors down, the world of sisig is yours for the taking.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add Annatto oil, lemongrass, half red onion, 2 smashed garlic cloves, 
            vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Rub the pork belly with the marinade and cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes or for best results overnight.</li>
        <li>Grill your marinated pork belly until it is cooked. About 10 minutes flipping a few times for good color.</li>
        <li>Cool the pork belly for a few minutes and chop it up into small pieces.</li>
        <li>In a bowl add the pork mixture and add more (3 tbsp) vinegar and (3 tbsp) soy sauce 
            for that extra sour and salty traditional flavor. This is what I like to call vinegar 
            dressing.</li>
        <li>Set your oven to broil.</li>
        <li>Broil for 5 minutes or until it is CRISPY. You want a Crispy Sisig.</li>
        <li>Garnish with an egg on top, remaining onion, green onions, and red chili peppers. 
            Add as little or as much red chili to make spicy sisig.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy with a cold beer.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>The heat from the cast iron and the meat will cook the raw egg and make a creamy sauce.</p>
